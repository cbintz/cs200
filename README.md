Programming Assignment 1 (PA1): My program takes as input a list of strings that contain logical
predicates. The predicates should be formed from variables that are denoted using capital letters,
and the operators ‘and’, ‘or’, and ‘not’, as well as parentheses. My program outputs a list
of assignments of the variables such that all predicates in the input list are true.
In other words, my program acts like a deduction or proof machine, that proves new
true statements, given a set of existing true statements.

Programming Assignment 2 (PA2): Scrapes the data from Middlebury's Computer Science Courses website to first create
an adjacency list representation of this graph. (The set of vertices consists of all CSCI classes
listed on the website.) Next, my program runs a breadth-first-search search on this graph,
starting from CSCI 0101, and outputs a list of all of the CSCI classes that are reachable from this
starting point. Finally, my program outputs a list of all of the classes that are not reachable from
CSCI 0101.
